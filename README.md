# Leave no medic behind

## 2022/2023

The Leave No Medic Behind Initiative Charity Run is a fundraising project by the Association of Medical Students of the University of Nairobi (AMSUN) to meet the financial needs of underprivileged students in the School of Medicine.

It began in 2017 when the then 5th year MBChB Class had a classmate who was almost denied to sit for their end of year exams because of a fees balance of less than sh 20,000. His classmates rallied together, each giving what they could and with that the student was able to sit for his exams and hence LNMB was born.

From 2017 to 2021, LNMB has primarily done student-centered funds drive using the harambee model however in 2022 there emerged the idea to organise for a charity run.

The project is being run in conjunction with the AMSUN Running Club- a registered club of runners in the School of Medicine. The project involves raising funds from sponsors and well-wishers plus the sale of T-shirts to participants who will take part in the run
